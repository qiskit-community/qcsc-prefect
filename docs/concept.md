# HPC-Prefect: Portable HPC Workflow Orchestration

**HPC-Prefect** is a Python framework that enables portable workflow orchestration across multiple HPC systems (Fugaku, Miyabi, and future Slurm support) using [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/). Write your workflow once and run it on any supported HPC system without modification.

## Core Concept

HPC-Prefect separates **execution intent** from **execution environment** by introducing a three-layer block architecture:

```mermaid

    A[Workflow Code<br/>algorithm logic + parameters] --> B[CommandBlock<br/>WHAT to run]
    B --> C[ExecutionProfileBlock<br/>HOW to run]
    C --> D[HPCProfileBlock<br/>WHERE to run]
    D --> E[Executor<br/>submits to qsub/pjsub/sbatch]

    style B fill:#fff4e1
    style C fill:#ffe1f5
    style D fill:#e1ffe1
    style E fill:#f5e1ff
```

This architecture allows:
- **Workflow portability**: Same workflow code runs on different HPC systems
- **Centralized expertise**: HPC administrators encode best practices in reusable blocks
- **User flexibility**: Users can tune resources without understanding system details

### Package Overview

#### [`qcsc-prefect-core`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-core/)
Core data models and resolution logic. Defines [`ExecutionProfile`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-core/src/qcsc_prefect_core/models/execution_profile.py) which represents execution intent independent of any specific HPC system.

#### [`qcsc-prefect-blocks`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks/)
Prefect Block definitions for the three-layer architecture:
- [`CommandBlock`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks/src/qcsc_prefect_blocks/common/blocks.py): Defines WHAT to execute (command name, executable key)
- [`ExecutionProfileBlock`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks/src/qcsc_prefect_blocks/common/blocks.py): Defines HOW to execute (nodes, MPI ranks, walltime, modules)
- [`HPCProfileBlock`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks/src/qcsc_prefect_blocks/common/blocks.py): Defines WHERE to execute (queue, project, system-specific settings)

#### [`qcsc-prefect-adapters`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-adapters/)
HPC system-specific adapters that handle job script generation and submission:
- [`miyabi`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-adapters/src/qcsc_prefect_adapters/miyabi/): PBS/Torque adapter for Miyabi
- [`fugaku`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-adapters/src/qcsc_prefect_adapters/fugaku/): PJM adapter for Fugaku
- Job script templates using Jinja2
- Runtime classes for job submission, monitoring, and cancellation

#### [`qcsc-prefect-executor`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-executor/)
High-level execution API that orchestrates the entire workflow:
- [`run_job_from_blocks()`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-executor/src/qcsc_prefect_executor/from_blocks.py): Main entry point for block-based execution
- System-specific runners: [`run_miyabi_job()`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-executor/src/qcsc_prefect_executor/miyabi/run.py), [`run_fugaku_job()`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-executor/src/qcsc_prefect_executor/fugaku/run.py)
- Automatic block resolution and job lifecycle management

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd qcsc-prefect

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -e packages/qcsc-prefect-core
pip install -e packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks
pip install -e packages/qcsc-prefect-adapters
pip install -e packages/qcsc-prefect-executor
```

### 2. Register Block Types

```bash
# Register blocks with Prefect
uv run prefect block register -m qcsc_prefect_blocks.common.blocks
```

### 3. Create Blocks

Create blocks programmatically or via Prefect UI. Example for Miyabi:

```python
from qcsc_prefect_blocks.common.blocks import (
    CommandBlock,
    ExecutionProfileBlock,
    HPCProfileBlock,
)

# Define WHAT to run
cmd = CommandBlock(
    command_name="my-simulation",
    executable_key="simulation_binary",
    description="My HPC simulation",
)
cmd.save("cmd-my-simulation", overwrite=True)

# Define HOW to run
exec_profile = ExecutionProfileBlock(
    profile_name="simulation-mpi-16",
    command_name="my-simulation",
    resource_class="cpu",
    num_nodes=2,
    mpiprocs=8,
    ompthreads=1,
    walltime="01:00:00",
    launcher="mpiexec.hydra",
    modules=["intel/2023.2.0", "impi/2021.10.0"],
)
exec_profile.save("exec-simulation-mpi-16", overwrite=True)

# Define WHERE to run (Miyabi-specific)
hpc_profile = HPCProfileBlock(
    hpc_target="miyabi",
    queue_cpu="regular-c",
    queue_gpu="regular-g",
    project_cpu="your-project-id",
    project_gpu="your-project-id",
    executable_map={"simulation_binary": "/path/to/simulation"},
)
hpc_profile.save("hpc-miyabi", overwrite=True)
```

### 4. Run Your Workflow

```python
from prefect import flow
from qcsc_prefect_executor.from_blocks import run_job_from_blocks

@flow
async def my_workflow():
    result = await run_job_from_blocks(
        command_block_name="cmd-my-simulation",
        execution_profile_block_name="exec-simulation-mpi-16",
        hpc_profile_block_name="hpc-miyabi",
        work_dir="./work/my-simulation",
        script_filename="my_simulation.pbs",
        user_args=["--input", "data.txt"],
    )
    return result

# Run the workflow
import asyncio
asyncio.run(my_workflow())
```

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **Workflow developers** focus on algorithm logic
- **HPC administrators** encode system expertise in blocks
- **Users** select appropriate profiles and tune as needed

### 2. Portability

The same workflow code runs on different HPC systems by simply changing the `HPCProfileBlock`:

```python
# Run on Miyabi
result = await run_job_from_blocks(
    command_block_name="cmd-simulation",
    execution_profile_block_name="exec-simulation-mpi",
    hpc_profile_block_name="hpc-miyabi",  # ← Change this
    work_dir="./work/simulation",
    script_filename="simulation.pbs",
)

# Run on Fugaku (same workflow code!)
result = await run_job_from_blocks(
    command_block_name="cmd-simulation",
    execution_profile_block_name="exec-simulation-mpi",
    hpc_profile_block_name="hpc-fugaku",  # ← Only this changes
    work_dir="./work/simulation",
    script_filename="simulation.pjm",
)
```

### 3. Centralized Expertise

HPC administrators create and maintain execution profiles that encode:
- Optimal resource configurations
- Required modules and environment variables
- MPI launcher settings and options
- System-specific best practices

Users benefit from this expertise without needing deep HPC knowledge.

### 4. Controlled Flexibility

Users can keep workflow code stable while changing behavior by:
- Switching block instances (`execution_profile_block_name`, `hpc_profile_block_name`)
- Passing command-line arguments via `user_args`
- Preparing multiple execution profiles (for example small/large scale) and selecting one at runtime

    HPC-->>Adapter: Job ID
    Adapter->>HPC: Poll status
    HPC-->>Adapter: Job completed
    Adapter-->>Executor: Job result
    Executor-->>User: Return result
```

### Execution Profile Model

The [`ExecutionProfile`](../packages/qcsc-prefect-core/src/qcsc_prefect_core/models/execution_profile.py) is the central data model representing execution intent:

```python
@dataclass
class ExecutionProfile:
    command_key: str
    num_nodes: int
    mpiprocs: int
    ompthreads: int
    walltime: str
    launcher: Literal["single", "mpirun", "mpiexec", "mpiexec.hydra"]
    mpi_options: list[str]
    modules: list[str]
    environments: dict[str, str]
    arguments: list[str]
```

This model is system-agnostic and gets translated to system-specific job requests by adapters.
