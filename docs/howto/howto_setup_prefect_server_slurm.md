# How to Run and Access a Prefect Server on a Slurm Login Node

This guide describes how to run a Prefect server on a Slurm login node and access the Prefect UI from your local computer using SSH port forwarding.

It also includes notes for running Prefect inside the `QFw-SLURM` container environment.

This setup is intended for small-scale development, testing and tutorial environments. For shared or production environments, use the Prefect deployment appropriate for your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure that:

- You have access to a Slurm cluster.
- You can SSH to the Slurm login node.
- Prefect is installed in the Python environment used for the workflow.

For the QFw-SLURM environment, also make sure that:

- The QFw-SLURM container environment is running.
- QFw is installed and configured.
- The target quantum device is configured in:

```text
/etc/openqse/qfw/device/device-access.yaml
```

## Step 1. Log in to the Slurm login node

From your local computer, connect to the Slurm login node:

```bash
ssh <username>@<login-node>
```

### Generic Slurm environment

Activate the Python environment containing Prefect:

```bash
cd /path/to/qcsc-prefect
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### QFw-SLURM environment

In the QFw-SLURM setup, run the Prefect server on the `slurmctld` container.

Enter the container using the mechanism appropriate for your QFw-SLURM deployment, then activate the QFw environment:

```bash
source /opt/openqse/qfw/bin/qfw-activate --venv /opt/openqse/qfw-venv
```

The QFw environment contains the QFw and QRMI libraries needed by the quantum execution path.

## Step 2. Start the Prefect server

Start the Prefect server:

```bash
prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0 --background
```

The Prefect server listens on port `4200`.

Using `--host 0.0.0.0` allows the server to be reached through port forwarding from outside the login node or container.

On a fresh Prefect installation, the active profile may be `ephemeral`.
When starting the server for the first time, Prefect may prompt you to either
update the current profile or create a new profile.
You can either continue using the ephemeral profile or create a dedicated profile, such as `sqd` and switch to it.

For example, on a fresh installation Prefect may prompt you to create a new profile:

```text
(env) [root@login-node]# prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0 --background

Prefect collects anonymous usage data to improve the product.
To opt out: set PREFECT_SERVER_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false on the server, or DO_NOT_TRACK=1 in the client.

The `PREFECT_API_URL` setting for your current profile doesn't match the address of the server that's running. You need to set it to
communicate with the server.

Configure Prefect to communicate with the server with:

    prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:4200/api

View the API reference documentation at http://0.0.0.0:4200/docs

Check out the dashboard at http://0.0.0.0:4200



The Prefect server is running in the background. Run `prefect server stop` to stop it.

```
## Step 3. Configure the Prefect client

Configure the Prefect client in the same environment to connect to the local Prefect server:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

Verify the active Prefect configuration:

```bash
prefect profile inspect
```

The active profile should show:

```text
PREFECT_API_URL='http://127.0.0.1:4200/api'
```

Verify that the server is accessible:

```bash
prefect server status
```

You can also verify the API directly:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4200/api/health
```

A successful response indicates that the Prefect server is running and accessible from the login node or container.

## Step 4. Access the Prefect UI from your local computer

The Prefect UI is served on port `4200`.

### Generic Slurm environment

If the Prefect server is running directly on the Slurm login node, open a new terminal on your local computer and run:

```bash
ssh -L 4200:127.0.0.1:4200 <username>@<login-node>
```

Keep this SSH connection open while using the Prefect UI.

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4200
```

in your local web browser.

### QFw-SLURM environment

If the QFw-SLURM environment is running locally, for example on your laptop and port `4200` is exposed from the `slurmctld` container, open the Prefect UI directly in your local web browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4200
```

You can verify access first with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4200/api/health
```

If the QFw-SLURM environment is running on a remote machine, create an SSH tunnel from your local computer to port `4200` on the remote host:

```bash
ssh -L 4200:127.0.0.1:4200 <username>@<remote-host>
```

Keep the SSH connection open while using the Prefect UI.

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4200
```

in your local web browser.

## Step 5. Verify Prefect from the workflow environment

Before creating Prefect blocks or running the SQD workflow, verify that the active environment is connected to the expected Prefect server:

```bash
prefect profile inspect
```

and:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4200/api/health
```

For QFw-SLURM, these commands should be run inside the `slurmctld` container after activating the QFw environment.


## Step 6. Stop the Prefect server

When the server is no longer needed, stop it in the environment where it was started:

```bash
prefect server stop
```

You can start it again later with:

```bash
prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0 --background
```
