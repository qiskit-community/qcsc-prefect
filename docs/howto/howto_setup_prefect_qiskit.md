# How to Set Up IBM Quantum Access Credentials for Prefect

This guide explains how to configure Prefect Qiskit integration to access IBM Quantum services from the MDX workflow server.

You will create two Blocks: (1) `IBMQuantumCredentials` and (2) `QuantumRuntime`. 

**Concept: Block** — Blocks store reusable configuration and credentials.  
You will create Blocks for IBM Quantum access for the HPC execution environment, so the Flow code remains simple.

### Step 1: Log in to MDX Workflow Client

Connect to MDX Workflow Client.

```bash
ssh -A z12345@mdx-workflow.example.org
```

### Step 2: Install Prefect Qiskit Package

Activate your virtual environment:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
source ~/venv/prefect/bin/activate
```

Install the Prefect Qiskit integration:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
uv pip install prefect-qiskit
```

### Step 3: Configure Prefect Profile

Switch to the Prefect profile:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect profile use mdx
```

Update your the prefect token (Only On-Prem Prefect) if token is expired:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect-auth login
/work/gz00/z12345/qcsc-prefect/scripts/prefect_sync_env_to_config.sh -p mdx
```

### Step 4: Register IBM Quantum Blocks
### 4.1 Register Prefect-Qiskit block schemas (one-time per environment)

Register the block schemas for Qiskit integration:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_qiskit
prefect block register -m prefect_qiskit.vendors
```

### 4.2 Create IBM Quantum credentials block
Create the IBM Quantum Credentials block:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect block create ibm-quantum-credentials
```

Open the displayed URL in your browser and fill in the fields below (copy/paste):

| Field | Value|
|---|---|
| Block Name | `ibm-quantum-cred` |
| Cloud Resource Name (CRN) | A string starting with `crn:v1:bluemix:...` from IBM Cloud |
| API Key | Your IBM Cloud API key (keep secret) |


The following image is the screenshot for the credential block.

### 5.3 Create `QuantumRuntime` block
Then, enter the following:

<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect block create quantum-runtime
```

Follow the URL shown to configure the runtime block.
Specify the IBM Quantum backend name and link the credentials block you created above.
You can also configure preferences for Qiskit primitive execution.

Open the URL and configure:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Block Name | `ibm-runner`|
| Resource Name | `ibm_kawasaki` (or the provided resource name) |
| Quantum Runtime Credentials | Select `ibm-quantum-cred` from the dropdown |
| Job Analytics | Enabled |

The following image is the screenshot for the runtime block.

> [!NOTE]
> If a real IBM Quantum backend such as `ibm_kawasaki` is not available, you can configure Qiskit Aer as an alternative backend.
> Follow the official prefect-qiskit tutorial here:
> [Use Qiskit Aer](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prefect-qiskit/blob/main/docs/tutorials/01_getting_started.md#use-qiskit-aer)
>
> In the Aer setup, create a `Qiskit Aer Credentials` block and configure the `QuantumRuntime` block with `Resource Name = aer_simulator`.
> If you already created the tutorial Variables for the Miyabi workflow, delete them from Prefect before switching to Aer because they cannot be used in this setup:
> `miyabi-bitcount-options`, `miyabi-tutorial`

Confirm you have access to the blocks you created:
<img src="../images/icon-mdx.png" alt="mdx" width="50"/><br>
```bash
prefect block ls
```

Example output:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID                     ┃ Type      ┃ Name        ┃ Slug                             ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩

└────────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

If the blocks don't appear, it's likely that the Prefect profile setup failed.
Go back to **Step 3** and ensure you have successfully logged in to the Prefect Cloud workspace.
